Consider the following problem. You have an array A[0], A[1], â€¦, A[n - 1] of distinct integers that has the following property: The values in the array increase up to index p for some p,
0 <= p <= n-1, and then decrease for all indices beyond p through position n - 1. You want to find the p index at which the peak value occurs, and what the peak value is.

Example: In the 6-element array illustrated below, the p index is 3, and the peak value is 4.

This program reads the input values (i.e., the array values) as a series of integers, one per line, from a text file and outputs the peak value and its index.
